This is a read me MD file for this bot. Thanks! 
<br>8.22.21 Adding a webhook for this bot. Checking updates.

<br> 8.28.21 Tested out some premade bots and was pretty impressed with the options out there. It is a lot of little bots though and I'd love to have an "all-in-one" bot that can do everything I need <i>specifically</i> for this server. 
<br> I don't mind my bot being public for others to use as a template for their server needs as well. Here's to hoping!
